"""
Command Centre Module

This module represents the CENTRAL COMMAND CENTRE for the ANPR system.

CRITICAL: This module is NOT ACTIVE yet. It is an intentional skeleton that
defines the future interface for centralized learning and intelligence.

NO CLIENT-SIDE LEARNING:
- All model training happens in the Command Centre
- Client deployments are inference-only
- This module will be implemented only in Command Centre infrastructure

DO NOT import or use these functions in client-side code until the Command
Centre infrastructure is operational.
